# Botspec

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/elliottmurray/botspec.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/elliottmurray/botspec)

Making specs for your bot that can be run in your build pipeline.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'botspec'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install botspec

## Usage

You will need to have AWS credentials set up. A dot file or env vars normally apply. E.g.
* AWS_REGION
* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

or better
* AWS_REGION
* AWS_PROFILE

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Running a command
To install run
```thor install lib/cli.thor --as botspec --force
```
Then you can run

```
thor cli:verify -f specs/simple_dialog.yaml
```


## Publishing
To publish run
```
rake release[remote]
```

Should create a changelog record

## Docker
You can run the command with:
```
docker run -e AWS_REGION -e AWS_PROFILE -v $HOME/.aws/credentials:/root/.aws/credentials:ro  -v `pwd`/specs:/app/bot/specs -it elliottmurray/botspec ./botspec.sh <botname> <relative path to fixture>
```

Assuming you are in your project root directory and your specs are in the corresponding specs folder

To build the docker container you may run something like:
```
docker build -t botspec .
docker tag botspec elliottmurray/botspec
docker push elliottmurray/botspec

```
